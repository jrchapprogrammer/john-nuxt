       <p>I make websites and web applications.</p>
       <p>I love taking things apart and putting them back together. My dad always taught me to know how things work, even if you don't have to physically make them work.</p>
       <p>My life and work experience span different sectors and industries, which has helped me to look for solutions from many different viewpoints.</p>
