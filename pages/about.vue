       <p>I am a Philadelphia-based, freelance web developer. I make websites, web applications, and am dabbling in mobile apps. I mainly work with front-end technologies, but I learn new things everyday.</p>
       <p>I love taking things apart and putting them back together. My dad always taught me to know how things work, even if you don't have to physically make them work.</p>
       <p>My life and work experience span different sectors and industries, which has helped me to look for solutions from many different viewpoints.</p> 
       <p>For prospective employers, you can find my technical resume <a href="https://jrchapprogrammer.github.io">here</a>.</p>
